## Agenda
- Ethics form role allocation
- Decide research question

## Actions

Deliverables for each week (may be subject to change depending on progress)

- Week 5: Ethics form done + Begin work on presentation
    - Front-end: Visual prototype
    - RAG: Scraping + document store
    - Speech recognition: 'Speech recognition' library tests
    - TTS: Not @ meeting, will discuss on teams (Look at libraries, initial tests)
    - Models: Results from evaluation, choice of evaluation LLMs
    - NLU: Research into NLU, how it fits into project
    - Whole group: Create slides for preparation of presentation.
        - [See here for presentation requirements.](https://canvas.hw.ac.uk/courses/28888/files/3822398?module_item_id=2076014)

## Research Quesiton Points
Given symptoms, what disease may you have?
- Compare website to agent (agent will likely do much better)?

Whether we should propose drug for given illness?
- explainable parts to drug?

Adding image input to experiments/research question?
- Supplementary but shouldnt hinge whole research question on this.

Fluent and natural dialogue
- Dialogue syncing with context.

## Research Question Confirmation
RAG in healthcare agent; **safety/accuracy** and efficiency?
- Safety/accuracy is more important in this 'use-case'
- Still will be quicker than driving out to doctor etc. Will lighten load of health-services.

Does RAG provide safer/reliable/accurate outputs from agent?

## Evaluation
RAG vs non-RAG agent. Perform set of tasks and user evaluates which performs better.

## Ethics

Ameen + Rohan will work on ethics form together.

Submission by week 5.

## Ethical Considerations

Lanting, Zewei - Ethical considerations that will be appended to Ethics Form.

Paragraph each - ethical considerations.

## Group Deliverables

### RAG

- Document store
- Agent querying/generating from it

### Front-end  GUI

- Visual prototype
- Functional prototype
- Refined UI
- Link to backend

### Automatic Speech Recognition

- Speech recognition test
- Link to front-end so it can be used for input

### Text-to-speech

- Static body-of-text tests
- Link to output of Agent
- Play through frontend

### Model Team

- Model testing/evaluation + Benchmarking
- Model implementation

### NLU

- NLU researching (will it be beneficial to model comprehension/understanding)
- NLU benchmarking
