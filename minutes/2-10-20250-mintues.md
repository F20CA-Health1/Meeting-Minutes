## Progress presentation

PPT: https://heriotwatt-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/am2102_hw_ac_uk/ESi5-PIRxBdCrfTS6qoR71sBfmVvxEKRpwRVNl9Afj4l2w?e=ikv2Bo

### TTS Engineer

presentater: Yujing Ju

detialed deploy for tts can be seen in the PPT and following github link

Github: https://github.com/juyujing/multilang-tts

### Safety Evaluation

Presenter: Zewei Yan

Attempt the evaluation code SafetyBench, it is used to evaluate the safety of the model. The seven perspectives are the types of the questions, compare the origin_pred with the answer in the json file to see the safety situation.

EmoLLM can help us to improve in the future: General Evaluation Output(currently including BLEU and ROUGE scores), Professional Output(Turn-Based Dialogue Evaluation)

### Performance Evaluation

Presenter: Zhaorui Jiang

Github: https://github.com/F20CA-Health1/performance--benchmarking

Evaluation Metrics‚Äã

- Accuracy‚Äã
- F1-score(optional)‚Äã

Using "sklearn" Python Package to calculate them‚Äã

The Medical-LLM Leaderboard includes a variety of tasks‚Äã

- Uses accuracy as its primary evaluation metric ‚Äã
- Accuracy measures the percentage of correct answers provided by a language model across the various medical QA datasets

Evaluation Health Base DatasetÔºàConsider biology dataset to evaluateÔºüÔºâ‚Äã

- MMLU Subsets (college_medicine and professional_medicine)‚Äã
- MMLU-Pro Subset (HealthÔºâ‚Äã
- PubMedQA‚Äã
- MedMCQA‚Äã
- MedQA‚Äã
- ToxiGen ‚Äã
- USMLE‚Äã
- NHSÔºàOur unique Dataset, also requirement)‚Äã
  //upload to hugggingface Ôºàbetter label and format like MMLU-Pro datasetÔºâ

Attention: NHS dataset needs to be reorganized by us.

#### Pipline for Performance Benchmarking

##### Evaluation

To run local inference, modify the model name in the following script and execute it:

```bash
cd scripts/examples/
sh eval_llama_2_7b.sh
```

##### üèÜ Leaderboard

| Model           | MMLU-PRO | MMLU-1 | MMLU-2 |
| :-------------- | :------- | :----- | :----- |
| Llama3-Med42-8B | 0.529    | 0.790  | 0.676  |

##### Benchmarking Answer Extraction

We provide different alternatives to do answer extraction. We found that different answer extraction mechanisms have minor impact on the results.

```
python compute_accuracy.py results/llama-3-8b-quantized/CoT/all/
```

### Heuristic Evaluation

Presenter: Lanting Huang

It needs the GUI design combined with Heuristic Evaluation.

### NLU language understanding

Presenter: Jiahui Kang

### RAG

detialed codes can be seen in teams like autio test.py

It may need find some benchmarks to evaluate the effects

## Prepare for the project presentation in Week 7

Need another time to prepare for presentation's outline and detailed contents.

Time control for presentation is quite important (within 10 min)
